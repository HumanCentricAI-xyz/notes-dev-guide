## Hello World

Behind the scenes, over a very long period of time, a disjointed group of individuals have been working towards a future methodology for 'digital transformation' of our societies, that seek to attend to a series of shared values, intent & purposes that have led to the unusual series of unfortunate events that have now led to the creation of this repo.

The purpose of the repo is to make more accessible, a body of underlying notes, relating both to our 'thoughtware', our past efforts, the objectives we hope to be able to progress, including the means to form improved capacities to do so..  

Whilst the broader 'high-level' term is 'Human Centric AI', this is neither a trivial objective to achieve, nor is it the only major outcome sought, in relation to the production of an ecosystem considered to be distinct and distinguisable from others that will invariably continue to exist, grow, develop, contend and compete with alternatives - as is considered overall, to be a desirable aspect and/or constituency for resiliance. 


## Differences & Shared Values

The development, proliferation and growth of 'human centric' information systems, designed to support many different forms of agents, including software agents of various kinds, has been tremendous over the past 25 years or so.  I think the monikier 'human centric', only really came about as a term applied to particular tooling & reltaed methodologies in the early 2010s, but such additional efforts were only made feasible due to the consequence of others efforts both before and since.  There are now a range of different views about what these sorts of terms and designs mean or should mean, and this diversity is sought to be provided nomenclature in a manner that is considerate and supportive of diversity, whilst supportive of STEM related resonance, seeking to ensure future users, those dependent, in good faith, that we have in-fact been clear about the characteristics of what is being provided; is reasoanbly comprehensible for the ICT Lay-person and indeed moreover, any court of law on a reasonable basis.

It is expected that this may well lead to many different contests, which are hoped to be processed methodically, enabling the representation of a comprehensive environment of facets related to any deliberations that may then be undertaken by observers, as to be empowered to form their own judgements and opinions, without undue interference or dishonourable influence by those involved in doing the work, on a best-efforts basis. 

Through such forms of processes, it is hoped that we may produce a form of living sythensis of what exactly our shared values really are, how they are articulated and form causal impacts, inferences and implications upon both ourselves and others. 

Fundamentally, the field of work relates to physics, and in-turn also, the sentience of art, by artisan or indeed also, those who may be considered either webizen or the creators of such things..

## init.

This repo is just being initiated now.  As such, i'm working through the initial structure. 

The current plan is to define a set of tasks, that will in-turn feed into projects. Each task and/or project should be assocaited with a MD File or folder that gives a description of what its about.  

## Metadata Policies

Whilst the formal outline is TBD (to be defined), information provided should include;
- date fields (when work was created  (cite), provided, amended, etc.) There can be several date-fields.
- Author / Contributor / Co-Creator(s)
- Links, References
- Version Tracking
- other (TBD)

NOTE:  understanding that there are alot of different forms of identifiers, in an effort to seek to address 'digital slavery' related problems, it is desirable to have some sort of economic function that's at least being used for testing purposes...  The belief presently, is that the use of [Bitcoin-ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/) ("eCash") tooling leads to no major issues that can be identified immediately; whilst in future, alternatives are sought.  It is important to also note, that these works should be permissively defined, and for the most part, 'open-source' from a public inspectability point of view; which, is different to considerations about licensing and in-turn also, unmet obligations that may exist that if disregarded may fail to attend to human rights related considerations for people doing useful work, for the betterment of humanity, etc.   This latter point, relates to an issue that has a level of significance beyond comprehension.  As such, it is expected that there will continue to be problems for sometime, whilst those involved in these activities are expected to make best efforts to ensure that actions, behaviours, decisions and related considerations are not exploitative and/or dishonourable. 

The considerations about the use of eCash and/or alternatives is one of the many tasks that is sought to be produced via these works and related efforts.

## Task List

In the short-term, the task list is sought to be curated via the 'projects' function of this repo. [Projects / Tasks Link](https://github.com/HumanCentricAI-xyz/notes-dev-guide/projects)

As soon as is pragmatically feasible, the systems are sought to be migrated to a platform that relates to the W3C RWW and W3C Solid & Semantic Web related spheres of work, that are on-going.  Particular attention is also sought to be provided to support the capacities of MyData related communities, whilst maintaining either or both categorisation and/or clear markers, in relation to any qualia of importance in relation to human rights related considerations.


## Moral Underpinnings

These works are guided by the best-efforts intepretations of human rights, as has been sought to be written down historically via United Nations works, including the [Core Instruments](https://www.ohchr.org/en/core-international-human-rights-instruments-and-their-monitoring-bodies) alongside [others by the UN}(https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-listings) and various other groups.  This is an important field of continued discussion and development, which is considered to be an essential constituency to broader 'Human Centric' (AI) works, whilst also producing the tooling required, to put moral views into practice.


## Financial Position

I've been working on solutions for this area of socio-technical humanitarian pursuits, overall, for decades.  This certainly escalated significantly from around 2009/10.  I have had the opportunity to work with many remarkable people, around the world, but note - that those, who've been doing some of the most remarkable work in this field, have also been doing so, in poverty. not all have survived.  The so called 'competition', has had dire consequences both upon those most involved in making headway, as well as, consequentially also, the masses.  Not everything can be discussed publically, due to human rights implications.  It remains the case today, that those whose works are amongst the more significant overtime, particularly in the areas where implications are unsettling for organisations of various kinds, that these people remain without the financial supports needed both to do better, but also, to have the consequence of past harms, remediated to the level that may be possible, notwithstanding the nature of some harms, having no available remedy, even in the best of circumstances.   These works are looking to 'turn a corner', both for those involved in creating the frameworks, but also, consequentially, the beneficiaries of the work - the people, the human minds & souls for whom, these works seek to support in a manner that is not unnecessarily encumbered by any form of unnecessary interferences.  

I do believe that people should be paid fairly for work, indeed, the instructuve outline is in human rights related instruments; and indeed also, related works.  but these obligations, are in-fact, limited... 

even if, it ends-up being the case that the volume of moral, material and financial obligations is significant; it will, nonetheless, be limited in some way; and overall, the focus should be on auditability. 

I hope this helps as a beginnings...  


### Why Human Centric AI XYZ

Originally, the repo (and domain) was intended to provide a space for doing a diverse array of works, with different standards organisations and groups relating to a vast body of work, that is broad-ranging.  This objective intent and/or purpose, somewhat remains the case, as the works (if progressed) are expected to involve a range of fields, from policy related works to ontological design and software development. 

There is not traditionally, or historically, any one standards organisation that covers all such aspects.  Rather, systems today largely do not provide a 'human centric' approach, but rather, an institutional or organisational approch, that continues to limit or dismiss the needs of natural persons, or indeed also, means to support both the rights, benefits, responsibilities and accountability needs and expectations of human beings, irraspective of their role in a particular context, as does essentially act to augment the manner in which disuputes are equipped to be addressed via 'digital transformation' infrastructure.

Yet also, these philosphical considerations also extend to our means to work with one-another to better address our needs as fellow members of our human family, which thereby leads to the conceptualisation and potential creation of new tools, methods, instruments and solutions; much as is necessarily developed, irraspective of the ideology.  (whether its 'human centric' or not)

causality is a function of physics.  what we do, has causal implications - both, upon ourselves, others and in some way, now too often undefinable, everything....

---

may spirit / god, guide us. we are all members of our human family. our efforts to form space for the works of each-other, one-another, to engender something greater than what we are otherwise able to achieve and/or accumplish by ourselves, in this area, should be something that can be done well, something, that is allowed..  something, that contributes towards the realisation of Humanitarian ICT foundations, as needed, due to 'digital transformation', by all.  These works, should support our inalienable human rights, which is not merely sought to be protected online - but fundamentally, in courts of law, with the resources required by those dutifully bound to their obligations to cast judgement in a manner that stands the test of time, as to honour those we seek to consider, worshipful.
