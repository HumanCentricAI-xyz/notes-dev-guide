# Bitcoin-ABC / eCash

For the purposes of this context, the idea being put forward is to explore and develop tooling that employs the Bitcoin-ABC / eCash project, to support socio-economic experiments involving DLTs. 

## About BitCoin-ABC / eCASH

[BitCoin ABC](https://www.bitcoinabc.org/) has been branded '[ecash](https://e.cash/)', both progressing works on the bitcoin protocol in addition to adding support for avalanche [whitepaper](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUy4jh5mGNZvLkjies1RWM4YuvJh5o2FYopNPVYwrRVGV)[website](https://avalanche.cash/)

[Bitcoin-ABC is MIT Licensed](https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/) whereby the monorepo provides a range of tools that are thought helpful.  There is an example 'chat' / publishing app - [ecashchat](https://www.ecashchat.com/), that has been forked ([Link](https://github.com/HumanCentricAI-xyz/ecash-chat)) which works well with the web-extension ([chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cashtab/obldfcmebhllhjlhjbnghaipekcppeag)) / web-wallet '[cashtab](https://cashtab.com/)' (note: if you get a cashtab wallet via the [ecash website](https://e.cash/) it provides some ecash for new wallets); whilst various other features also employ IPFS, such as is exampled by [ecashchat.com](https://www.ecashchat.com/).

Whilst there are some challenges brought about by a protocol framework that is not owned by a company, but rather, has an economic mechanism to support the cost of maintaining the ecosystem, via [GNC](https://gnc.e.cash/), this is also, arguably, desirable for an internet protocol - notwithstanding various other related requirements, as to support (and protect) human rights.

## History

Some work was done sometime earlier, with a view to establishing an integration between these ecosystems and [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) or [RWW](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/) based systems and/or solutions. Sadly, meaningful progress did not lead to any usefully available working code.  These forms of pursuits are both, conceptually further developed; and also, still considered to be amongst the considerations of importance moving forward.  

## Deliberations

During this time of development, a great deal of research was undertaken, which is intended to be provided and/or incorporated into the broader scope of works; relating to tasks. for instance, the means to create improved 'bookmarks' and search interfaces, would help to transfer the existing research from google sheets, into more accessible online formats; but, the useful purpose of such work isn't limited to achieving that objective task alone... 

### Economic considerations - obligations vs. rents

Commercial solutions, that may seek patents or other protections; thereby often seek to gain incomes in perpetituity, and whilst many fail to achieve this - some, end-up increasing the cost of - life..   Conversely, work intended to 'benefit humanity' is sought to be done at the express cost of the people doing it. as is in-effect, a form of punishment.  not even the costs of doing it are covered by beneficiaries.  In-order to address what is in-effect a form or field of issues relating to 'digital slavery' and related 'digital transformation' of wrongs, the means to figure out how to define and seek to meet an 'obligation cost' prior to derivatives of works becoming 'obligation free' needs to be established somehow.  This is thought likely to be achievable via ontological design, and infrastructure.  yet, neither presently exists.  So, these works should be considered to be a field of RD&D where the results are sought to end-up with something that's 'ready for market', whereas doing the work, is something for developers.  therein, the meaning of developers, SHOULD NOT be limited to persons engaged in software programming activities solely and specifically.  Rather, the derivatives of these works, ends-up as software; and, likely also, policy, advocacy, and various other outcomes and consequences.

###  non-financial Currencies

There are tokens, that can be used for various purposes; that may not have the intended purpose of primarily defining some sort of economic price.  This is in-turn part of the subject and/or topic area for broader body of works, that may act to evaluate ontological currencies, related needs, requiremnets, safety protocols, policies, etc.

### Related Projects / Ideas

A related project is the notion of 'Agent Discovery Protocol' ("ADP"), which was provided as a very simple illustration of the use of an RDF file in connection with a domain or sub-domain; whereby, within this file, a persons addresses (ie: bitcoin-abc address) could be both, disclosed and therefore also, made discoverable.

This method was in-turn intended to be complimentary (and compatible) with WebID & therefore also, FOAF & related [specifications for solid](https://solidproject.org/specification)

## Critical Path

There is an on-going problem where people are expected to both fund the work they do, which incorporates the need to fund the cost of their own lives (and that of any dependents) whilst then providing the derivatives of their work freely to people, who - then exploit it, for gainful income.  This has been a long-term problem.

The means to figure out how to address this, has been the subject of extensive works overtime; that has nonetheless, never got to a point where a solution to it, has been effectively implemented.  Doing so, is expected to be non-trivial; and, will require iterations.  The belief is that experimentation with the ecash ecosystem, is likely to provide a suitable training ground, to figure it out. future outcomes should end-up ensuring supports for multiple protocols, as is reasonably appropriate - from a humananitarian perspective...  The useful purpose of these works, should be to seek to move units about, as to thereby seek to commence works that have the intended purpose of seeking to address the underlying issues. 

### Known Limitations

The ability to qualify the value of a persons prior-works, cannot be effectively done in the short-term.  Therefore, any flows are not expected to provide an accurate account; which, is something that is sought to be achieved overtime, as broader graph capabilities are deployed, enhanced and therefore also, developed.
